    <h2>The NorthSec 2018 Badge</h2>
    <p>
        Hey! You found a URL on the badge!</br>
        Here is some useful information about the NorthSec badge.
    </p>
    <h3>Schematics</h3>
    <p>
        You can download the full schematics
        <a href="hw/northsec_2018_schematics.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Battery charge</h3>
    <p>
        Protip: Charge the badge with LED and display off to minimize charge
        time.
    </p>
    <h3>Customizing your badge</h3>
    <h4>LED patterns</h4>
    <p>
        The badge has preprogrammed LED patterns you can chose from the menu.
        Some of them can be unlocked by finding "codes" in various
        places during the NorthSec conference.
    </p>
    <h4>LED Bluetooth service</h4>
    <p>
        The exposed service with UUID `CBCA0000-BFBE-BDBC-BBBA-AFAEADACABAA`
        controls the RGB LEDs on the badge. The LEDs are driven by a port of
        the `WS2812FX` Arduino library. The LEDs can be represented as a segment
        with the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Index: a number that represent the "id" of that segment</li>
        <li>Start index: The first LED of the segment</li>
        <li>Stop index: The last LED of the segment</li>
        <li>Mode: Number that represent the pattern to execute on that segment (from basic and extra list)</li>
        <li>Colors: An array of 3 colors to use by the different mode</li>
        <li>Speed: The number of milliseconds between the evolution of the mode</li>
        <li>Reverse: Switch the mode direction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you change the LED pattern or the LED settings, you actually
        change the segment 0. Over BLE is possible to create your own set of
        segments, you can create a segment from LED 0 to LED 3 then another one
        from LED 4 to LED 7. The only common parameter will be the brightness.
        The service expose every parameter over different characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating your own pattern:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Unlock your service by sending your sync key in text in the Sync Key
            characteristic, you can read back the `Is Unlock` characteristic to
            check if your service is unlocked.</li>
        <li>Select your segment index with the Selected Segment characteristic</li>
        <li>Select the first and last LED with the Start Index and Last Index
        characteristic (LED index can overlap with other segments, it's just more fun)</li>
        <li>Select the mode with the Mode characteristic</li>
        <li>Default colors are BLEU-RED-GREEN but you can change them with the Colors characteristic</li>
        <li>Optional, change the Speed</li>
        <li>Optional, set the Brightness</li>
        <li>Set the segment to active using the segment `Is Active`
            characteristic and tadam. The result will stay even if you turn off
            your badge. You will lose your pattern if you select the segment 0
            when you select a new one from the list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can set the segment to active at anytime and then make modification
        and see the feedback in real time.

        The badge exposes a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) service that allows you
        to customize the name on your badge wirelessly.

    <p>To create a customize your badge you shall:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Connect to your badge via BLE. Your badge ID is on the top left of
            the screen</li>
        <li>Write your sync key to to "Sync key" characteristic.</li>
        <li>Write your name as an ASCII string to the "name"
            characteristic.</li>
        <li>Write a 128 byte bitmap to change your avatar</li>
        <li>Write a random value (or nothing) to the "Sync key" characteristic
            to relock and protect your badge from so-called "hackers".</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hacking your badge</h3>
    <p>
        The USB port exposes a serial device that act as a gdb stub. It is
        based on the
        <a href="https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic">Black Magic
        Probe</a>. You can use it to read, write and debug the nRF52 micro
        controller with only a micro USB cable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Source code will be available soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Come back later. We will update this page and explain the cool stuff
        about it.
